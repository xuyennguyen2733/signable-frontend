NOTE: You can deploy both your frontend and backend to the same resource group

1. Create a resource group in azure
2. Create a web app using code and appropriate node version
3. Install the Azure extension in VS code
4. In the folder public of your project, create a file called web.config with the following content:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<configuration>
    <system.webServer>
        <rewrite>
            <rules>
                <rule name="React Routes" stopProcessing="true">
                    <match url=".*" />
                    <conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll">
                        <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" negate="true" />
                        <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsDirectory" negate="true" />
                        <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" pattern="^/(api)" negate="true" />
                    </conditions>
                    <action type="Rewrite" url="/" />
                </rule>
            </rules>
        </rewrite>
    </system.webServer>
</configuration>

5. In the terminal

RUN npm run build

6. Go to Azure in VS Code, under Resources, expand your plan tab
7. Expand App Services -> you should see the web app you created
8. Click Ctrl+Shift+P and type deploy
9. Select Azure App Service: Deploy to Web App...
10. Make sure to select your build folder as the deployed folder (not your source code)
11. Make sure the built folder is aware of where your index.html is (best to place it in the top level)
